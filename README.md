# News Homepage Challenge

This is my submission for the News Homepage Challenge from Frontend Mentor, done with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Description

The News Homepage Challenge is a design challenge where participants are given a design for a news website's homepage and are asked to recreate it using HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. For this particular submission, I used Next.js to build the application and Tailwind CSS to style the components.
